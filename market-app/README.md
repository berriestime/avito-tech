## Problems

Unfortunately, I didn't have enough time to create a ordering page.
I tried Tailwind and RTK Query for the first time, and I want to say, it was a great experience!
Tailwind is a really cool library, it's so flexible and easy to use.
RTK Query is also a great tool, it's much easier to learn than regular RTK.
